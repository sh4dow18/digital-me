Here the Project Vision will be explained, which shows why it was created

> [!NOTE]
> This Vision was created using my knowledge in **Scrum**

#### Problem Definition

The problem is that **Braitec: Soluciones Tecnológicas** desires a more flexible digital environment for configuration than what social media platforms provide. Limitations on these platforms affect the company's ability to:

- **Customize effectively**: Social media platforms offer limited customization options, restricting Braitec's ability to effectively showcase its technological services and solutions.
- **Control over user experience**: Lack of flexibility in digital setup prevents Braitec from creating a consistent and personalized digital experience for its clients and users.
- **Scalability and specific functionality**: The need for specific functionalities and adequate scalability to accommodate Braitec's growth and evolution cannot be fully met by standard social media platforms.

#### Who Does It Affect?

This problem affects several types of people, including:

- **Founder**: As the sole operator of the startup, the founder faces significant challenges in effectively managing Braitec's digital presence. Limitations on social media platforms hinder the creation of a robust and personalized online presence. This can lead to less effective communication of the company's capabilities and services, impacting the attraction and retention of potential clients.

- **Clients**: Clients of Braitec are also affected by these limitations. They may experience difficulties in accessing clear and detailed information about the services offered, due to the lack of flexibility in the company's digital platform. This can affect the overall client experience and perception of Braitec's professionalism and technological capability.

#### Impact of Not Undertaking the Project

Not developing the project can have a significant impact, which can be mentioned as follows:

- **Limited visibility and customer attraction**: The lack of a robust and personalized digital presence would limit Braitec's ability to attract new clients and potential partners. This could affect business growth and expansion.

- **Reduced market competitiveness**: Inability to clearly communicate the company's capabilities and services could make Braitec appear less professional and competitive compared to competitors with a strong digital presence.

- **Impaired customer experience**: Current and potential clients may struggle to obtain accurate and detailed information about Braitec's services. This could lead to a less satisfactory customer experience and lower customer retention.
