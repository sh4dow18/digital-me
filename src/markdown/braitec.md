### <img src="https://emojiapi.dev/api/v1/eye/32.jpg" alt="VISION" height="18"/> Vision

Here the Project Vision will be explained, which shows why it was created

> [!NOTE]
> This Vision was created using my knowledge in **Scrum**

#### Problem Definition

<THIS IS AN EXAMPLE>

The problem is that creating a custom desktop environment for Linux by installing package by package can take hours, up to 10 hours. In the case of a system failure or wanting to clean up by reinstalling the system, even more time is required to redo the custom desktop environment. This generates several inconveniences, including:

- **Loss of time and efficiency**: Configuring a custom desktop environment from scratch consumes a considerable amount of time, resulting in a loss of productivity.

- **Difficulty in replicating the environment**: When reinstalling the operating system or troubleshooting, replicating the exact desktop environment becomes complicated and requires remembering and manually reconfiguring all customizations.

- **Lack of automation**: Not having an automated process for configuring the environment means that each adjustment and package must be installed and configured manually, which is tedious and prone to errors.

#### Who Does It Affect?

<THIS IS AN EXAMPLE>

This problem affects several types of users, including:

- **Individual users**: Users who configure their own custom desktop environments are the most affected. They experience a considerable loss of time and effort in manually installing and configuring each package, which can lead to frustration and disruption in their workflow, especially when facing system failures or deciding to reinstall the operating system.

- **Developers**: Developers who need a specific environment for their work suffer from having to spend hours configuring their development environment each time they install or reinstall the operating system. This is not only an inefficient use of time but can also affect productivity and project deadlines.

#### Impact of Not Undertaking the Project

<THIS IS AN EXAMPLE>

Not developing the project can have a significant impact, which can be mentioned as follows:

- **Frustration and demotivation**: The constant need to replicate configurations after system failures or reinstalls can result in a frustrating experience, demotivating users from continuing to customize their desktop environment.

- **Frequent interruptions in workflow**: Without a solution to automate the configuration, interruptions in workflow due to operating system reinstalls will continue to be a recurring problem, negatively affecting the continuity and quality of users' work.

- **Risk of losing customizations**: In case of system failures or the need for reinstalls, users will continue to face the risk of losing all their customizations, which can lead to a negative experience and greater distrust in the stability and usability of the Linux operating system.
